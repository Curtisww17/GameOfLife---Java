# GameOfLife---Java
John Conway's Game of Life

Programmed by Wesley Curtis

You can run the GameOfLife class to be able to put in a starter file, and the program will figure out what the next generations will look like and output them to an output file. The program will determine if there is a sequence, and tell the user at what generation the sequence occurs.
